○ Option 1. Feature Importance. Dynamic Time Warping and/or XGBoost/Shapley Value hybrid model approach to quantify which factors influence the target positively or negative ■ Keep the analysis focused on the feature selection and feature importance aspects.

○ Option 2. LSTM derivatives on day ahead prediction with confidence bounds ● How would you improve and present your results with more time and resources ● Related thinking and planning in a short report.

## Natural Language Understanding 

● Use World Bank Projects dataset

○ Option 1. Tagging for Keyword Extraction or Named Entity Recognition (NER) using models such as YAKE, BERT-derived models, spaCy, or Google NLP API ■ Specifically identify either “sector” or “sub-sector” or entities like Government Agency, Company Name, Contractors, Investor, or unit measurements such as cost per square kilometer.

● Option 2. Binary Classifier
