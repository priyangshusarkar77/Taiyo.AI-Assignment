# Time-Series Analysis
● Use any daily time series from Investing.com or similar source with a strong sample of
covariates. Target commodities price like: Oil, Natural Gas, Resin, or Metal Prices.
○ Please make sure to get an extensive list of feature space, think through
structural other external factors.

○ Option 1. Feature Importance. Dynamic Time Warping and/or XGBoost/Shapley
Value hybrid model approach to quantify which factors influence the target
positively or negative
■ Keep the analysis focused on the feature selection and feature
importance aspects

○ Option 2. LSTM derivatives on day ahead prediction with confidence bounds
● How would you improve and present your results with more time
and resources

● Related thinking and planning in a short report
